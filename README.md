Objective:
This project focuses on the general overview of the COVID-19 pandemic. We'll be generating insights from two datasets that have information on global populations, cases, deaths, and vaccinations across various countries and continents. These insights will be the foundation on which will be used to make data-driven decisions with respect to the pandemic.
